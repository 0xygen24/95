If someone can make these boxes in win95 style, that would be great as I can't figure out how.
So for now they are in win10 style or whatever os you're using style, so it kinda breaks the immersion.
This app requires guizero

## Installation

### Windows

```cmd
pip install guizero guizero[images]
```

### MacOS/Linux

```bash
pip3 install guizero guizero[images]

```
